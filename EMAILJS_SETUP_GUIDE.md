const serviceId = "YOUR_SERVICE_ID"; // Replace with your Service ID from Step 2
const templateId = "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"; // Replace with your Template ID from Step 3
const publicKey = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"; // Replace with your Public Key from Step 4
```

const templateId = "template_xyz789";
const publicKey = "user_def456ghi";
```

4. Fill out the gift card donation form
5. Upload test images (front and back of card)
6. Submit the form
7. Check your email inbox (matchinggift1@gmail.com) for the donation notification

## Important Notes

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size per image: 5MB
- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF
- EmailJS free plan has a limit of 200 emails per month

### Security
- Your EmailJS keys are safe to use in client-side code
- EmailJS handles the email sending securely
- Never expose your email password in the code

### Troubleshooting

**If emails are not being sent:**
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify all three IDs (Service ID, Template ID, Public Key) are correct
3. Ensure your EmailJS account is verified
4. Check that you haven't exceeded the free plan limit (200 emails/month)
5. Make sure the email service is properly connected in EmailJS dashboard

**If images are not appearing:**
- The images are sent as base64 encoded strings
- Some email clients may block base64 images
- Consider using a file upload service (like Cloudinary) for better compatibility

### Alternative Solutions

If you need more advanced features, consider:

1. **Backend API**: Create a Node.js/Express backend with Nodemailer
2. **Serverless Functions**: Use Vercel/Netlify functions
3. **Form Services**: Use services like Formspree Pro or Getform
